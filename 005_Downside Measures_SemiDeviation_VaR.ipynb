    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to look at a few measures of downside risk. We've already seen how to compute drawdowns, but we're going to look at 3 popular measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first measure is the simplest, which is the semideviation, it's nothing more than the volatility of the subset of returns that are negative. It's an alternative measurement to standard deviation or variance and a method of measuring the below-mean fluctuations in the returns on investment. Semi-deviation will reveal the worst-case performance to be expected from a risky investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second measure is Value at risk (VaR) is a statistic that measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm, portfolio or position over a specific time frame. This metric is most commonly used by investment and commercial banks to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios. Risk managers use VaR to measure and control the level of risk exposure. One can apply VaR calculations to specific positions or whole portfolios or to measure firm-wide risk exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third measure of downside risk is Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), also known as the expected shortfall, is a risk assessment measure that quantifies the amount of tail risk an investment portfolio has. CVaR is derived by taking a weighted average of the “extreme” losses in the tail of the distribution of possible returns, beyond the value at risk (VaR) cutoff point. It's used in portfolio optimization for effective risk management."

    "## Parametric Gaussian VaR\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric method VAR (also known as Variance/Covariance VAR) calculation is the most common form used in practice with hedge fund managers. This method is popular because the only variables you need to do the calculation are the mean and standard deviation of the portfolio. The biggest assumption that mangers using Parametric VAR are making is that the returns from their portfolios are normally distributed. This allows the manager to use the calculated standard deviation to compute a standard normal z score to determine his/her risk position with a degree of confidence right off of a standard normal table. This is an important assumption because it allows the manager to use the normal distribution as a proxy for what expected returns might look like. In practice, this assumption of return normality has proven to be extremely risky. Indeed, this was the biggest mistake that LTCM made it gravely underestimating their portfolio risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a parametric VAR calculation is as follows:  \n",
    "Standard Deviation ($ terms): $50,000  \n",
    "Mean ($ terms): $35,000   \n",
    "Z Score for 95% confidence: 1.65  \n",
    " \n",
    "Calculated VAR for the period with 95% confidence is: 35,000 - 50,000 (1.65) = -$47,500  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this is very simple. If a set of returns is normally distributed, we know, for instance, that 50% of the returns are below the mean and 50% are above. We also know that approx two thirds of the returns lie within 1 standard deviation. That means one third lie beyond one standard deviation from the mean. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, approximately one sixth (approx 16%) lie below one standard deviation away from the mean. Therefore, if we know the mean and standard deviation and if we assume that the returns are normally distributed, the 16% VaR would be the mean minus one standard deviation. In general we can always convert a percentile point to a z-score (which is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that a number is). Therefore, if we can convert the VaR level (such as 1% or 5%) to a z-score, we can calculate the return level where that percent of returns lie below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scipy.stat.norm` contains a function `ppf()` which does exactly that. It takes the cumulative % or the percentile such as 0.05 or 0.01 and gives you the z-score corresponding to that in the normal distribution."
